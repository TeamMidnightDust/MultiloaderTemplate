# MultiloaderTemplate
Template that helps creating mods for Fabric/Quilt and Neoforge at the same time by making use of Architectury and MidnightLib.  
Also features Unified Publishing, which allows you to publish your mod to both Modrinth and CurseForge with one single gradle task.  

After downloading, replace all occurances of "yourmod" with your desired mod id and "Your Mod" with your mod name.  
I recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (scroll down for the free version) to create Java mods.  
If you need any more assistance, feel free to ping me (@Motschen) on my [Discord server](http://discord.midnightdust.eu/).
